        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            A Vertex Painter that stores vertex colors within a texture instead of 
            the model. Each texel represents a vertex and its corresponding color. 
            One texture is generated for each mesh that has been painted in a scene (including sub-meshes). 
            Sub mesh index is represented with a <code>_x</code> postfix.
            <br>
            These textures can vary in size and is 
            determined whilst painting depending on how many meshes have been painted on. 
            <br>
            A binary file which includes all material binding information is also generated, and is read from 
            on scene load. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The generated folder structure looks something like this

        <h3>How painting works</h3>
        <p>
            The painter itself works by sampling the G-buffer (we use a deferred rendering method within our engine) 
            in editor view to get meshes' world positions and EntityIDs in order to both get active meshes with in a scene, and to 
            translate the screen space mouse position to world position coordinates   
            <i>(The world position could be reconstructed from the depth buffer, but it we have this RTV for convenience 
                and debugging with minial performance losses)</i>. 
            When world space coordinates are retrieved, the relative position in model space is then compared to all vertices within 
            all meshes within the brush radius to find the intersecting verts. 
        </p>
