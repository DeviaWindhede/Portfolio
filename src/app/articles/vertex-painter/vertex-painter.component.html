        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            A Vertex Painter that stores vertex colors within a texture instead of 
            the model. Each texel represents a vertex and its corresponding color. 
            One texture is generated for each mesh that has been painted in a scene (including sub-meshes). 
            Sub mesh index is represented with a <code>_x</code> postfix.
            <br>
            These textures can vary in size and is 
            determined whilst painting depending on how many meshes have been painted on. 
            <br>
            A binary file which includes all material binding information is also generated, and is read from 
            on scene load. 
        </p>

        <h3 #selection>How painting works</h3>
        <p>
            The painter itself works by sampling the G-buffer (we use a deferred rendering method within our engine) 
            in editor view to get meshes' world positions and EntityIDs in order to both get active meshes with in a scene, and to 
            translate the screen space mouse position to world position coordinates   
            <i>(The world position could be reconstructed from the depth buffer, but it we have this RTV for convenience 
                and debugging with minial performance losses)</i>. 
            When world space coordinates are retrieved, the relative position in model space is then compared to all vertices within 
            all meshes within the brush radius to find the intersecting verts. 
        </p>

            The vertex color output is generated by sampling the texture that was generated by the Vertex Painter. 
            Since each pixel represents a color that is unique for each vertex within each mesh variant instance, we need to know a few things: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1. Which UV coordinate-span represent the vertex colors for the current mesh variant
            </li>
            <li>
                2. Which one of the colors within the span represents the current vertex that is being rendered 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To solve the first issue, I reserved the (0, 0) location for describing the total vertex count of the mesh variant. 
            <i>
                This could be stored within a buffer and will lead to performance gains, however during development 
                this was really useful for debugging and is something that will be changed in the future.
            </i> 
            Nonetheless, the vertex count is then used to get the initial index that represents the first 
            vertex color within the span.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>{{vertexShaderPart1}}</code>
        </pre>

        
        <p>
            To fetch the color based using the vertex index is then achieved with some simple addition, where the appended values are 
            clamped by the texture dimensions

                Here's an example of the tool in action, showcasing it's potential! The draw calls also stay the same, since each mesh is 
                drawn by instance. 
                The pixel shader used for this showcase simply lerps between the bound material textures based on the vertex colors as the lerp interpolator value, 
                on the albedo, pixel normal, material and emissive output textures to the G-buffer

            The painter also works on an per-entity selection mode, where the user is restricted to painting on meshes they have selected prior to painting (during "Object Selection Mode"). 
            However, if no meshes are selected, it simply paints on the object the mouse is currently hovering over.

                This is a 22x3 snippet from the of the top-left most UVs of a 1024x1024 vertex color texture that is currently used within one of our games. 
                The alpha channel has been set to 255 to be able to visualize the texture structure. Since the (0, 0) color is {{'{ 20, 0, 0, 0 }'}}, it means that 
                the current mesh has a vertex count of 20, meaning every 20+1 pixels in the texture represents another mesh instance.

            Since there can exist multiple meshes within one .fbx file, each sub-mesh is given its own texture. Due to this the generated textures 
            use the naming convension of <code>{{'meshName_{subMeshIndex}'}}</code> so it texture binding becomes as straight forward as possible. 
            Generated vertex color textures use the R8G8B8A8_UNORM color format, and the resulting folder structure looks something like this:

        <h3>Conclusion and Final thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            This is a way of implementing vertex painting without any vertex data creation or modification. Some perks with this is that it is really easy and intuitive to 
            render all painted meshes using instanced draw calls. 
            The figure blow visualizes how the vertex painter causes vertex colors to only be applied to an affected (painted) area, even when using instanced rendering. 
            The vertex normals without any face culling are shown to more easily showcase the mesh arrangement of the scene.

            Since all vertex data is stored in textures using a linear pattern, it is also possible to combine them all into a mega texture in the future! 
            The performance hits to consider is the texture sampling done in the vertex shader and the RAM usage with slot bindings and the textures SRVs being stored in memory and the painting performance as well.  
            So all in all, it works quite well! c:

        <p>
            Due to a time crunch, I never got the opportunity to implement decals that showcase selected vertices and brush radius.
            Because of this, <a (click)="scrollToSelection()">I used some debug gizmos (DirectXTK) to draw quads rotated towards the vertex normals to get some type of visualization.</a> 
            Though it is something that I would love to do in the future! Especially since we use a deferred rendering method
