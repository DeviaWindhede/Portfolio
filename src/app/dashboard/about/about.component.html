                Hi!! I'm Devia and I'm a student from The Game Assembly who is seeking an internship starting August 2024! 
                I began my coding adventures at the age of 12, where I learned to program by creating Minecraft mods. 
                As time passed I started to create some personal projects from scratch, be it games, websites or utility software. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to studying at TGA I worked as a front-end developer, but since my passion lies in game development I enrolling at TGA 
                and it has been nothing short of amazing! I've learnt and grown so much in such a short period of time, 
                and I am really grateful for all the opportunities that I have been given
            </p>
            <p>
                As a colleague I am enthusiastic, like to help others, analytical and easily excitable as I get psyched from the smallest of things. 
                I like to communicate both within the local team and cross-disciplinary to make sure everything works. 
                I really enjoy performance optimizations, memory management and low-level programming, however I am quite flexible in my capabilities!
            </p>
